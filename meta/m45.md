## Proximity to a Grocery Store
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of a full-service, chain grocery store

### Why is this important?
Healthy food and physical activity are essential for combating obesity, reducing preventable chronic diseases and promoting overall healthy living. Grocery stores can provide access to a greater variety of cheaper and healthier foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, helping to facilitate healthier dietary choices. While they are not included here, Farmers' markets provide another source of community access to fresh, locally produced fruits, vegetables and other food products, and may be particularly important in areas poorly served by full-service grocery stores. Proximity to a grocery store is only one aspect of accessibility. Other factors that affect access are cost, hours of operation, transportation, and geographic barriers such as major highways.

#### How are we doing?
Overall, 30% of housing units in Mecklenburg County had proximity to a chain grocery store in 2018, up from 26% in 2011. The total number of full-service, chain grocery stores in Mecklenburg County is constantly increasing - 141 in 2011 to 161 in 2018.



#### Did you know?
In 2014, 24% of people in Mecklenburg County were medically overweight or obese, 18% experienced food insecurity over the past year, and 7% of low- and moderate-income households had limited access to healthy foods. Through community-wide action planning, the Mecklenburg County Health Department is working to improve access to healthy foods and food choices through: building community and school gardens, working to have SNAP benefits accepted at farmer's markets, attracting full-service grocery stores to food deserts and improving healthy school lunch and vending machine choices.
