### Why is this important?

Mecklenburg County's library system offers books and e-books, music and videos, homework assistance, and a variety of programs and activities for all ages, from story time to writing contests to job and technology training programs. In addition, the computers, internet and printers found at the library are a critical resource for users who lack these technological resources at home.
