## Residential Renovation
Concentration of residential units permitted for renovation

### Why is this important?
Renovation permits are issued for existing residential housing units for projects such as remodeling, adding space, building garages, or retrofitting to improve energy efficiency or allow aging in place. Residential renovation activity provides an indication of how and where people choose to invest in housing, and may be impacted by a broad variety of factors including housing market trends, household size and income, construction lending standards, age and condition of available housing stock, and neighborhood amenities. A large increase in renovation activity, especially in established neighborhoods, could signal broad-based neighborhood change that may impact housing affordability, particularly for renters or households with fixed incomes. 

#### How are we doing?
In fiscal year 2018, 6,930 residential units were permitted for renovation, 49% more than 2013.
 
#### Did you know?
According to a 2013 report by the [Joint Center for Housing Studies](http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research/improving-americas-housing), annual owner improvement spending in the Charlotte area totals almost $3,200 per household.
