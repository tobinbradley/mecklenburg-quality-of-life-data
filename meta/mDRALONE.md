## Commuting by Driving Alone
Commuting by Driving Alone

### Why is this important?
Commuters driving alone can take advantage of cost savings from less fuel and vehicle wear, reduced roadway and parking congestion, reduced environmental impact and other benefits by participating in carpooling or rideshare opportunities.

### About the Data
This data indicates the percentage of surveyed residents who commute by driving a personal vehicle such as a car, truck or van with no additional passengers. 

As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 years' worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this measurement are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.
