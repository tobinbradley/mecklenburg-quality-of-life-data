## Median Gross Rent
Median Gross Rent

### Why is this important?
The median gross rent is one of only a few commonly-available indicators of the changing cost of renting in neighborhoods. Significant upward shifts in value can reflect neighborhood housing market pressures that can adversely affect low income renting households. 

### About the Data
The median gross rent is at the midpoint of all rent costs for each neighborhood. Half of the rental units in this Census tract cost more and half cost less. Gross rent includes the contract rent plus estimated monthly costs of utilities and heating fuels if these are paid for by the renter (ACS).
