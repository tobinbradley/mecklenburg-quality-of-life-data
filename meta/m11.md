## Vacant Land
Percentage of land area that is classified as vacant

### Why is this important?
Land that is undeveloped or otherwise empty of any taxable structure is becoming scarce in Mecklenburg County. As the population grows, more housing and services are needed to support the influx of new people and growing businesses, all of which require space. Change in the percentage of vacant land reflects the pace of growth.

Existing vacant land ranges from small parcels nested in the heart of urban neighborhoods to large tracts of land outside of city limits. No matter where the land is located, however, zoning regulations are in place to guide future developments. While developing land adds to its value and increases the local tax base, development must be balanced with the preservation of land for natural areas and open space.

#### How are we doing?
Not surprisingly, in a rapidly urbanizing county, the amount of vacant land has steadily decreased from approximatley 18% in 2011 to 16% in 2021.

#### Did you know?
Mecklenburg County developed acreage per person is 0.23, only slightly higher than the national metro area average of 0.22 acres per person.

### About the Data
Total area of tax parcels classified as vacant divided by total land area. 

Vacant land is classified as part of a land use survey conducted by the Charlotte Planning, Design & Development Department through a variety of sources including tax data, building codes, existing datasets (e.g., parks, daycare locations, threatened agriculture), aerial imagery, and field verification.
