## Proximity to Public Transportation
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of a transit stop

### Why is this important?
Residents in neighborhoods with convenient access to transit have more opportunities to use the bus or train as an alternative to vehicle travel. Individual benefits of having easily accessible and reliable public transportation includes less cost associated with owning and operating a private vehicle and potential health benefits of increased physical activity. Community benefits include improved air quality and reduced congestion on the roadways. In addition to proximity, a variety of other factors impact transit ridership including service frequency, transit cost and hours of operation, vehicle ownership and parking availability, traffic congestion levels, employment rate and employment density, and more.

#### How are we doing?
Overall, 67% of housing units were in proximity to public transportation in 2018, only a very slight increase from 2011. There were 3,079 bus stops, 6 streetcar stops and 26 light rail stations in 2018. In 2018, CATS' buses drove more than 11.4 million miles, serving 14.6 million customer trips. Light rail added 6 million trips.

#### Did you know?
A study in King County, WA demonstrated that for every quarter mile increase in distance to transit, the likelihood of using transit fell by 16%.
