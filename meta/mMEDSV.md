## Median Home Sale Value
Median Home Sale Value (Inflation-Adjusted)

### Why is this important?
Home sales are a key reflection of how desirable and affordable a community's housing stock is. Changes in the value of homes can reflect increasing market interest in a neighborhood, broader changes like economic recessions and even demographic shifts. 

### About the Data
This information reflects home sales reported in Tax Administration property records from 2001 through 2016 and includes 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-family homes, condos, townhouses, mobile homes, and non-residential buildings converted to residential. Large multi-unit commercial residential sales are excluded. Dollar amounts have been inflation adjusted to 2016 values using the Consumer Price Index for housing.
