## Average Year of Residential Construction
Average Year of Residential Construction

### Why is this important?
The age of housing generally reflects the development history of the city - Durham's oldest neighborhoods have average residential construction years in the 1920s and 30s. This measure can also indicate greater maintenance needs for a community's housing stock. If a community has a concentration of building code violations and aging housing it may warrant focused efforts in repairing, restoring, and preserving housing.

### About the Data
The average age of all residential units - including single-family, multi-family, townhouse and all other residential categories.
