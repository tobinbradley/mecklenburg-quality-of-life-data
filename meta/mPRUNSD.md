## Poor and Unsound State of Repair
Poor and Unsound State of Repair

### Why is this important?
A property's state of repair is often directly influential on the quality of life of its occupants. This measure reports the two most severe categories of deterioration, poor and unsound, as a percentage of all owner- and renter-occupied residential units. For neighborhood areas showing the highest concentrations of poor and unsound properties (between 3.5% and 8% of all residences) the impacts can be considerable to neighborhood safety, public health, and even property values. In those areas, multiple poor and unsound properties can be found on a single block.


### About the Data
State of repair for all properties is reported in 5 categories in the Tax Administration's property records. The five categories are good, normal, fair, poor, and unsound. The latter two are defined as follows: poor, showing marked deterioriation; unsound, may be unfit for habitation or condemned. For the measure reported here, these two categories are combined.
