## Unmaintained Property Violations 
Unmaintained Property Violations

### Why is this important?
Unmaintained properties can have a serious impact on neighborhoods. Unmaintained lots can influence property values for surrounding homes, they can draw increased criminal activity, and they can become home to unwanted vermin and pests. The City of Durham ordinance regarding unmaintained properties is enforced by the Neighborhood Improvement Services department.

### About the Data
The number of unmaintained property violations divided by the square miles of each blockgroup that lie within the City boundary. This measurement includes all unmaintained property ('weedy lot') violations, not including calls found to be not in violation or those involving commercial properties. This measurement, along with residential building code violations and abandoned, hazardous or junked vehicles reflect a City-only service and parts of Durham County are not represented by this data.
