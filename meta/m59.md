## Crime - Property
Property crime rate per 1,000 residents

### Why is this important?
The incidence and perception of crime impacts residents in many ways. For individuals, fear of crime and feelings of vulnerability can cause chronic stress and health concerns, serve as a disincentive to go outdoors, and decrease life satisfaction. For neighborhoods, crime can decrease neighborhood socializing and social cohesion, and may inhibit investment from new residents and businesses. Strategies to decrease crime and increase perceptions of safety include starting a neighborhood watch program, getting to know your neighbors, actively communicating concerns to your community police officers, and improving environmental conditions such as visibility and lighting.  

#### How are we doing?
The county-wide totals are not comparable over time periods due to the addition and subtraction of town data. However, trend data are available for areas that have data in multiple time periods. 

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department reported 36,892 property offenses overall in calendar year 2016, a 6.3% increase from the 2011-2015 5-year average. The number of burglaries was 5% less than the average, larceny (which accounts for almost three-quarters of all property offenses) was 20% higher, vehicle theft was 38% higher, and arson was 14% higher. 

#### Did you know?
According to the 2014 Charlotte Citizen Survey, 86% of residents report feeling very safe or somewhat safe in their neighborhood. There are approximately 260 active Neighborhood Watch programs in Mecklenburg County.
