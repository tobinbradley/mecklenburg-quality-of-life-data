## Adopt-a-Street Participation

### Why is this important?
Neighborhoods, businesses, individuals and organizations can make a difference in their community by adopting a city street and committing to three clean-ups a year - picking up litter, marking storm drains, reporting graffiti and removing illegal signs. Litter can reduce the value of real estate, deter a customer from entering a business or a new employer from locating to a community, and cause damage to water quality and wildlife. Maintaining order by picking up litter or removing graffiti can encourage others to "follow the rules" and may increase community safety. Working together to clean up streets can also promote community building and participation in neighborhood events.

#### How are we doing?
There was an increase of 121 miles of adopted streets from 2011 to 2015. Volunteers remove almost 1,000 bags - about 17,700 pounds - of trash each year from Charlotte streets. The most frequently littered items are cigarette butts, food remnants, and food wrappers. In fiscal year 2014, 134 groups donated 2,584 hours of time to cleaning up 981 miles of streets.

#### Did you know?
The presence of litter in a neighborhood decreases property values by about 7%, according to a pricing model from the National Association of Home Builders.
