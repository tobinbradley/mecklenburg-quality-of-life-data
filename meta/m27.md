## Water Consumption
Average daily water consumption for single-family housing units

### Why is this important?
Access to an adequate supply of water is paramount to life and health. Water is required for everyday activities such as individual consumption, recreation, agriculture and industry. Reducing water consumption saves money for households and reduces demand on the  water supply. Equally important, reducing water consumption also reduces energy consumption, as it takes energy to pump, heat, treat and deliver water. 
*Small* daily behavior changes and household improvements can have *large* impacts on water consumption. Strategies to reduce household water use include installing low-flow fixtures and water-saving appliances, fixing water leaks, turning off the tap while brushing teeth or washing dishes, and creating a water-smart lawn and landscape.

#### How are we doing?
Average single-family household daily water consumption decreased from 177 gallons per day in 2010 to 152 gallons per day in 2020. According to an analysis from Sustain Charlotte, household monthly water consumption in gallons decreased from 7,181 in 2003 to 5,236 in 2012, an average annual decrease of 3%. 

#### Did you know?
Nationwide, lawn watering and landscape irrigation is estimated to account for nearly one-third of all residential water use, totaling nearly 9 billion gallons per day. The average family can waste 180 gallons per week or 9,400 gallons of water annually, from household leaks. That is the equivalent to the amount of water needed to wash more than 300 loads of laundry.
North Carolina State University developed the [Turf Irrigation Management System (TIMS)](http://turf-ims.ncsu.edu/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=/) that uses current weather data to identify the optimum amount of time to water a lawn, in minutes per day.

### About the Data
Total annual residential water consumption in hundred cubic feet (CCF), multiplied by 748 to convert to gallons, divided by 365, divided by the number of residential accounts for single-family housing units. 

Areas with fewer than 10 accounts are suppressed and represented as N/A. The data do not include multi-family structures utilizing a single meter, irrigation meters, homes on well water or non-residential structures.
