## Residential New Construction
Concentration of residential units permitted for new construction 

### Why is this important?
Residential new construction may be single- or multi-family, and can be built on previously undeveloped land, as infill on vacant urban lots, or as replacement housing where other structures have been demolished. New construction activity provides an indication of how and where people choose to live, and may be impacted by a broad variety of factors including housing market trends, household size and income, construction lending standards, the availability of developable land, age and condition of available housing stock, and neighborhood amenities. New residential construction generally increases population and housing density, and in established neighborhoods, an increase in new construction may also impact housing affordability, particularly for renters or households with fixed incomes. 

#### How are we doing?
There were 12,751 housing units permitted for new construction in fiscal year 2021, 60% more than in 2016. The rate of new residential permits has gone up every year since 2011 except for a slight decrease from 2015 to 2016. As the population and number of households in Mecklenburg County continues to grow, so too will the need for new housing units. According to a 2021 report by the [Joint Center for Housing Studies](http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research/improving-americas-housing), single family housing starts are up by 13.2%.
