## Tree Coverage
Tree Coverage

### Why is this important?
The presence of trees in neighborhoods is essential for maintaining cooler temperatures (reducing the 'heat-island effect'), reducing noise, beautifying streets and parks, and even enhancing pedestrian safety. Trees also have profound environmental and health benefits, absorbing and filtering water run-off around paved areas and diluting air-borne pollutants. To learn more about the benefits of neighborhood tree coverage see the EPA fact sheet linked below.

### About the Data
This measurement is derived from 2009-2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program one-meter digital photography for the EPA EnviroAtlas, and reports only on the urbanized area of Durham County. It represents the percent of total land cover within each block group that is tree canopy, whether in forests, along streets, or individual trees.
