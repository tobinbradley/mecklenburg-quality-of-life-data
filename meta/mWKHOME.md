## Working from Home
Working from Home

### Why is this important?
This measurement includes persons telecommuting to employment based in locations elsewhere, in addition to those with other home-based occupations. The transportation impacts of increased home-based employment can be significant in terms of reduced vehicle miles traveled, congestion, and travel demand.

### About the Data
As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 years' worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this ACS product are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.
