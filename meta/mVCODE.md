## Automotive Code Violations 
Automotive Code Violations

### Why is this important?
In addition to being unsightly, abandoned and junked vehicles can also be hazardous, whether by leaking contaminants, providing shelter for vermin and pests, or by attracting criminal activity. The City vehicle ordinance is enforced by the Neighborhood Improvement Services department.

### About the Data
The number of automotive code violations divided by the square miles of each blockgroup that lie within the City boundary. This measurement includes abandoned and hazardous, as well as junked vehicle violations. It excludes calls found to be not in violation. This measurement reflects a City-only service and parts of Durham County are not represented by this data.
