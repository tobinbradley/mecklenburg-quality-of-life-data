Median Homebuyer Income

### Why is this important?
The relative wealth of homebuyers in neighborhoods can help express neighborhood changes over time, answering questions about who is moving into homes compared to who already lives there. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data is one of the only reliable sources of lending patterns at the neighborhood level. Along with understanding the socioeconomic character of borrowers (seen here), it reports whether a mortgage is originated, its value, and whether it is for investment or owner-occupancy. 

### About the Data
Dollar values are adjusted to most-recent-year dollars to offer a real comparison in household wealth. Records included in this analysis are for origninated, owner-occupant mortgages only.
