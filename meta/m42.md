## Commercial Building Age
Average age of commercial buildings

### Why is this important?
The age of commercial buildings generally reflects the development history of the county - Charlotte's oldest commercial districts are closer to the center city, while new commercial buildings continue to be built across the county. A decrease in average age in an area may indicate in-fill or redevelopment in an older district, or a large commercial center constructed on previously undeveloped land. Aging commercial structures may provide opportunities for rehabilitation, reuse and "greening" improvements to promote energy efficiency. In addition, since sewer, power and other infrastructure that serves commercial buildings is generally reflective of building age, local governments and developers can identify potential risks and make necessary improvements, especially as codes and standards are updated and improved over time.

#### Did you know?
Of the 5.9 million commercial buildings in the United States in 2018, about 25% were built after 2000. Newer buildings tend to be larger than older buildings. Buildings build between 1960 and 1999 accounted for more than 50% of both total number of buildings and of floorspace. Buildings built before 1960 represent 21% of buildings but only 17% of floorspace.
In Mecklenburg County, the average age of commercial buildings has increased only marginally from 34 years in 2011 to 36 in 2020.
