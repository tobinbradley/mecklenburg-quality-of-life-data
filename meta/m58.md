## Crime - Violent
Violent crime rate per 1,000 residents

### Why is this important?
The incidence and perception of crime impacts residents in many ways. For individuals, fear of crime and feelings of vulnerability can cause chronic stress and health concerns, serve as a disincentive to go outdoors, and decrease life satisfaction. For neighborhoods, crime can decrease neighborhood socializing and social cohesion, and may inhibit investment from new residents and businesses. Strategies to decrease crime and increase perceptions of safety include starting a neighborhood watch program, getting to know your neighbors, actively communicating concerns to your community police officers, and improving environmental conditions such as visibility and lighting.

#### How are we doing?
The county-wide totals are not comparable over time periods due to the addition and subtraction of town data. However, trend data are available for areas that have data in multiple time periods.

There were more than 514,000 police interactions in 2020 up 16% over 2019.
