## Median Home Value
Median Home Value

### Why is this important?
The median home value reflects both the value of a household's investment (and this data refers exclusively to owner-occupied units) and the relative cost of purchasing a home in a neighborhood. Significant upward shifts in value can reflect neighborhood housing market pressures that can adversely affect low income and renting households.. 

### About the Data
The home value at the midpoint of all home values. Half of the homes in this Census tract are valued higher and half valued lower. These amounts are inflation-adjusted for 2010 using the Consumer Price Index for all items, referencing the South urban areas (table CUUR0300SA0).
