## Test Proficiency - Elementary School
Percentage of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) students in grades 3-5 proficient in End of Grade testing

### Why is this important?
Elementary test scores, particularly third grade reading proficiency, are a critical indicator of future academic success. Test scores can assist education administrators, policy-makers, businesses, residents, and community organizations in tracking academic performance and developing strategies to increase academic proficiency. Since these data are based on where students live, regardless of what school they attend, they may help identify areas where community-based services and resources are needed to support student success. Research has identified a number of factors that contribute to test score proficiency, including early childhood experiences, school attendance, summer learning opportunities, family support, and high-quality teaching in school, home, and community settings. 

As a measure of student progress, *growth* in test scores is just as important as proficiency. Growth and proficiency should be evaluated together to better understand student and school success.

#### How are we doing?
Countywide, approximately 48.1% of students in grades 3-5 were proficient in both reading and math tests. Proficiency rates are expected to rise as teachers and students adjust to the new content standards and expectations, as has happened in other states implementing new standards.  

#### Did you know?
Research from the Annie E. Casey Foundation showed that 16% of students who are not reading proficiently by the conclusion of third grade failed to graduate from high school on time - a rate four times greater than that for proficient readers.

### About the Data
Number of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) students in grades 3-5 achieving a proficient score (Level III,IV or V) on both reading and math end of grade tests divided by the total number of CMS students in grades 3-5 taking both reading and math end of grade tests. 

Data are based on the home location of the student, regardless of which school they attend. Areas with fewer than 5 students are suppressed and represented as N/A. Students attending charter schools, private schools, or home schools are not included in CMS data.  

Note: The year displayed is the year in which the school year ended (e.g. "2019" reflects information from the 2018-2019 school year).
