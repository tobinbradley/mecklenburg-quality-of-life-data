## Sidewalks-to-Roadways
Sidewalks-to-Roadways

### Why is this important?
This rate indicates how well-served an area is by sidewalks. It is meant to be read as the rate of sidewalk length to roadway length in a neighborhood. If the rate is more than 100%, it is likely due to sidewalks existing on both sides of many neighborhood streets.

### About the Data
The intention of this measurement is to indicate how well neighborhood roads serve pedestrians. Pedestrian or bike paths not adjacent to roadways are not among the sidewalks counted here. Areas reporting 'N/A' are outside City limits and do not contain annexed communities - the City does not maintain or build sidewalks in those areas.
