## Households Within Walking Distance to Banks
Households Within Walking Distance to Banks

### Why is this important?
Banking is a core community service, providing financial planning, savings, and management services to households. Neighborhoods without easy access to such core services are transportation dependent for primary needs, leading to higher costs of living and reliance on inadequate convenience services.

### About the Data
This measurement includes both commercial bank locations and credit unions. These are identified primarily by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 52211 and 52213. The 1/4 mile distance is Euclidean, or as-the-crow-flies.

|[About the Community Reinvestment Act](https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/) | The Community Reinvestment Act is intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking operations. It was enacted by the Congress in 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901) and is implemented by Regulations 12 CFR parts 25, 228, 345, and 195..
|[Community Reinvestment Act - Community Input](https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/contactus/feedback.aspx?Submit=Submit) | The CRA requires that each depository institution's record in helping meet the credit needs of its entire community be evaluated by the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency periodically. Members of the public may submit comments on a bankâ€™s performance. Comments will be taken into consideration during the next CRA examination. A bank's CRA performance record is taken into account in considering an institution's application for deposit facilities.
