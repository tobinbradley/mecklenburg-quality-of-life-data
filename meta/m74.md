## Proximity to Public Outdoor Recreation
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of an outdoor public recreation area

### Why is this important?
Recreational facilities provide opportunities for physical activity and social interaction, both key components of good physical and mental health. Increased physical activity is associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, cancer, stroke, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality, independent of obesity. Research suggests that people who live closer to sidewalks, parks, and gyms are more likely to exercise. In a growing region like Charlotte-Mecklenburg, protecting land set aside for outdoor recreation is important to maintaining access to recreation opportunities and the community's engagement with nature and the outdoors.
