## Education Level - High School
Percentage of adults over age 25 with a high school diploma or equivalent

### Why is this important?
Adult education levels are closely related to individual economic opportunity, financial stability, and even health. Education levels are also a factor in business location and expansion decisions, as they indicate both the qualifications of the workforce and the potential market for certain goods and services. Educational attainment varies widely by age, family income, and race and ethnicity. At the neighborhood level, differences in educational attainment can persist across generations, as children living in neighborhoods with high adult educational attainment tend to have greater exposure to the world of work and higher expectations for their own education and employment prospects.

#### How are we doing?
The percentage of adults in Mecklenburg County without a high school diploma or equivalent was 10% in 2017, down from 12% in 2010. Typical of urban areas, Mecklenburg County's percentage is slightly lower than North Carolina (13%) and the United States (13%). 

Note: In order to make equal comparisons to the smaller areas, the values for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina and the United States in the previous paragraph are also from the American Community Survey 2013-2017 5-Year estimates. While more current 1-year estimates are available for the larger areas, it is important to use the most precise and most comparable 5-year estimates.

#### Did you know?
The unemployment rate drops significantly for each level of education attained. Nationally, the unemployment rate in 2017 was 7% for those without a high school diploma; 3.8% for those with an Associate's degree; and 2.7% for those with a Bachelor's degree or higher.
