## Crimes With a Violent Component
Crimes With a Violent Component

### Why is this important?
The violent crime rate is an indicator of basic community safety and well-being. Residents, organizations, and government alike can use this information to address high rates of violent crime where they exist and to monitor the impact of efforts to stop violent crime.

### About the Data
Violent crimes are commonly reported with parts 1 and 2 separate. This measurement is different, including all part 1 violent crimes and these part 2 crimes: simple assaults, certain sex offenses, child abuse and kidnapping. The number of these violent crimes occurring in each boundary is divided by the area (in square miles) of the boundary, rather than the population. This is intended to control for how crime often happens in areas that are less populated. For more detailed Durham crime reporting visit RAIDS Online.
