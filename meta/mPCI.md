## Per Capita Income
Per Capita Income

### Why is this important?
Per capita income is a reflection of the comparative income of individuals, rather than households. While it is still a reflection of the economic resiliency of a neighborhood it is also influenced by the types of occupations residents pursue, whether they work full- or part-time, and local unemployment rates.

### About the Data
Average obtained by dividing aggregate income by total population of an area. These amounts are inflation-adjusted for 2011. 

As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 years' worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this measurement are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.
