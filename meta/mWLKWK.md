## Walking to Work
Walking to Work

### Why is this important?
A higher number of residents walking to work reflects residential proximity to employers, a safe pedestrian network, and/or a preference or necessity to walk. Walking has health and financial benefits, but as an alternative to driving it offers many of the same environmental and infrastructural benefits as biking or working from home: reduced vehicle miles traveled, reduced congestion, and reduced travel demand.

### About the Data
As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 years' worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this ACS product are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.
