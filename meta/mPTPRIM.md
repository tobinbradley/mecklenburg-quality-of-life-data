## Primary election participation
Primary election participation

### Why is this important?
Not all registered voters vote in a primary election, though in North Carolina they can. In some states, only those affiliated with a party are able to vote for their party's candidates. In North Carolina any registered voter can cast a ballot in a primary. <br><br> Typically, many fewer individuals vote in primary elections, and those that do are expressing additional interest in local or partisan issues and policies. As an indicator of engagement this measurement is both a reflection of above-average voting activity, and a reflection of deeper engagement in the political process and its institutions.

### About the Data
The data included in this measure reflect active voters only. The Board of Elections codes voters 'inactive' when their most recent address may be inaccurate. Due to the potentially inaccurate addresses of inactive voters, this spatial analysis relies only on the active voters. As of January 2014, there were 176,148 active voters out of a total 200,885 registered in Durham County.
