## Bicycle Friendliness
Index measuring the transportation network's ability to comfortably support cycling 

### Why is this important?
Cycling has positive transportation, environmental, economic and health benefits. As traffic congestion and automobile ownership cost continue to rise, cycling increasingly becomes a less expensive, traffic-reducing and environmentally-friendly option for travel and recreation. However, much of the decision to ride a bike is based on the safety of infrastructure, the ability to safely share the road with vehicles, proximity to employment and other destinations, and connections to transit (e.g., bike racks on buses).  

The bicycle friendliness index score ranges from 1 (least friendly) to 3 (most friendly). The index indicates an area's ability to comfortably support bicycling by combining many different variables, including low speed streets, completed bike lanes and greenways, and multiple street connections

#### How are we doing?
Prior to 2000, there were no bicycle lanes in the City of Charlotte. Today, there are over 90 miles of bicycle lanes and 56 miles of signed bike routes in the city as well as 58 miles of greenways throughout the county.
  
According to the Alliance for Biking and Walking, cities have average 1.8 miles of bicycle facilities per square mile. In Charlotte, there are approximately 0.6 miles of bicycle facilities per square mile. 

In 2015, 0.2% of people in Charlotte reported commuting to work regularly by bicycle, ranked 49 out of 52 of the nation's largest cities. Portland, OR (6.1%) has the largest share of bike commuters, followed by Minneapolis, MN (3.6%) and Seattle, WA (3.4%).
 
#### Did you know?
All CATS buses have bike racks. In FY 2016, there were 95,450 riders that boarded a bus with a bicycle, or an average of 265 per day.

### About the Data
The index is calculated with the following formula:  
(Low Speed Street Miles + Bike Lane Miles + Completed Greenways/Multi-use Path Miles)  divided by  (Total Street Mileage + Total Completed Greenways/Multiuse Path Mileage).

The result is a score between 1 and 3 with 1 being least bicycle friendly and 3 being most bicycle friendly. Low speed streets are streets with a speed limit of 25mph or less. Unpaved paths without a surface intended to support most bicycles are not included.
