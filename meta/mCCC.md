Child Care Centers

### Why is this important?
Foundational stages of brain development that guide behavior and health for years to come occur before age 5. [Research](http://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/reports_and_working_papers/foundations-of-lifelong-health/) has shown that positive, healthful early development environments lead to more resilient brain development and greater flexibility in the acquisition of skills throughout life. Stable, high-quality child care in the early years of child development has life-long implications. <br> <br> Access to quality care can be compromised by inadequate local facilities or public transit service, challenges posed by neighborhood safety and other environmental or economic factors.
