## Neighborhood Organizations
Number of neighborhood organizations registered with the Charlotte Housing & Neighborhood Services Department

### Why is this important?
An active neighborhood organization is a key component of community health, safety, and stability. Residents working together can solve local problems, influence local decisions, maintain community standards and social control, and create a welcoming and connected network of neighbors. Registered organizations are utilized as an information-sharing outlet for government staff, and serve as a way to gather input and feedback from neighborhoods across the county. Also, grants and other community building opportunities are more readily available for organizations with active residents working on behalf of their neighborhood. 

#### Did you know?
