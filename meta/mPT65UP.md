## Retirement-Age Population
Retirement-Age Population

### Why is this important?
This measurement indicates the total 65 and-up population of an area. Higher concentrations of aging adults can reflect a greater need for supportive programming, accessible public and private facilities, and proximity to core needs and services.

### About the Data
The percent of population 65 years of age and older is calculated using the same Decennial Census counts of population as those used for total population, population density, and race and ethnicity. The population 65 years and older is divided by the total population for each blockgroup.
