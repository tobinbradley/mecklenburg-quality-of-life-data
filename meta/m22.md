## Proximity to School-Age Care
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of a licensed school-age program for children ages 5-12

### Why is this important?
School-age child care programs support working families and can provide children with enrichment and academic opportunities that promote healthy development and school success. Proximity to care is only one aspect of accessibility. Other factors that affect access are program cost, availability of financial assistance, program capacity, hours of operation, and geographic barriers such as major highways.

#### How are we doing?
In 2015, there were 638 licensed school-age child care programs, down from 642 in 2013; Approximately 68% of housing units had proximity to school-age care. 
 
#### Did you know?
In addition to licensed school-age child care, children in Kindergarten through 12th grade are served by a wide variety of license-exempt out-of-school time programs in Mecklenburg County, including academic and arts enrichment, summer camps and scouting, and mentoring and leadership development opportunities.
