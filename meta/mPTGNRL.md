## General election participation
General election participation

### Why is this important?
Participation of registered voters in general elections reflects one of the primary activities of civic engagement. There are many reasons voters may or may not participate in a general election (which occurs every four years and includes the election of a presidential candidate). At its root, where a voting age population exists this measurement reflects the degree of community engagement in our electoral process and the perception that it is meaningful in the lives of community members.

### About the Data
The data included in this measure reflect active voters only. The Board of Elections codes voters 'inactive' when their most recent address may be inaccurate. Due to the potentially inaccurate addresses of inactive voters, this spatial analysis relies only on the active voters. As of January 2014, there were 176,148 active voters out of a total 200,885 registered in Durham County.
