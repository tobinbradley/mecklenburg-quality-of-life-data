## Energy Consumption - Electricity
Average monthly household electricity consumption

### Why is this important?
Residential use accounts for approximately 20% of all energy consumption in the United States. Reducing electricity consumption saves money for households and reduces the demand for energy production, which can reduce pollution and protect natural resources. *Small* daily behavior changes and household improvements can have *large* impacts on energy consumption. Strategies to reduce household electricity use include sealing and insulating walls, windows, doors and floors, using a programmable thermostat, using energy efficient appliances, equipment, light bulbs and fixtures, switching to alternate heating and cooling strategies such as fresh air and ground source heat, and regular cleaning of filters, registers and vents. 

#### How are we doing? 
Total U.S. energy consumption in homes has remained relatively stable for many years as increased energy efficiency has offset the increase in the number and average size of housing units. Charlotte's average monthly electricity consumption per household increased slightly from 1,126 kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2011 to 1,183 KWh in 2011. Total residential energy consumption increased by more than 274 million kWh, or 189,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. To offset this increase would require 4.9 million tree seedlings grown for 10 years. 

Note: Due to its unique nature, this variable, while not up-to-date, remains part of the report while we identify ways to update and enhance the data. 

#### Did you know?
According to the national Residential Energy Consumption Survey, on average, residents living in newer homes built from 2000 to 2009 used 19% more total energy than residents living in homes constructed in the 1980s.

### About the Data
Total annual electricity consumption in kilowatt hours (kWh) divided by twelve, divided by the number of housing units with electricity service for the fiscal year. 

Data was received at the block group level and aggregated to the Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) geography. Areas with fewer than five residential customers are suppressed and shown as N/A.
