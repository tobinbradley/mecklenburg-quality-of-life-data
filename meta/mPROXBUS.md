## Households Within Walking Distance to Bus Stops
Households Within Walking Distance to Bus Stops

### Why is this important?
Household proximity to public transit indicates transportation options for those with cars and indicates access to regional transportation for those without cars. This measurement is one of three included in the Compass that gauge the effectiveness of public transit service to neighborhoods (daily and nightly bus arrivals are the other two).

### About the Data
Households include all residential units, not just residential parcels. The 1/4 mile distance is Euclidean, or as-the-crow-flies. Bus stop locations used in this calculation are those active during the spring of each calendar year.
