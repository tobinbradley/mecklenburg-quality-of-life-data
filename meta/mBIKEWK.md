## Commuting to Work by Bicycle
Commuting to Work by Bicycle

### Why is this important?
This measurement indicates the proportion of residents who ride bicycles to work in each area, but it also implies a certain degree of proximity to workplaces. In addition, it may reflect the perceived safety of biking in each selected area and lower household access to cars or public transit.


### About the Data
As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 years' worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this measurement are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.
