## Median Household Income
Median Household Income

### Why is this important?
The median household income provides an indication of how well people are doing financially in a neighborhood. Lower wage earners may have higher percentages of their income devoted to consumption and less for saving, making them less resilient in economic downturns. Higher wage earners may have more of their income available for consumption and more savings that can enable them to be more resilient in economic downturns. Service providers and retailers look at income levels to help them locate their services.

### About the Data
The household income at the midpoint of all households. Half of the households in this Census tract earn a higher annual income and half earn a lower annual income. These amounts are inflation-adjusted for 2010 using the Consumer Price Index for all items, referencing the South urban areas (table CUUR0300SA0).
