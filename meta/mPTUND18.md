## Youth Population
Youth Population

### Why is this important?
This measurement indicates the total youth population of an area. Higher concentrations of school-age children can reflect greater need for youth-specific programming, community recreation facilities and other opportunities for skill and occupational development.

### About the Data
The percent of population under 18 years of age is calculated using the same Decennial Census counts of population as those used for total population, population density, and race and ethnicity. The population under 18 years of age is divided by the total population for each blockgroup.
