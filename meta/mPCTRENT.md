## Renter-Occupied Housing
Renter-Occupied Housing

### Why is this important?
Higher percentages of rental units in a blockgroup may indicate an increased need for services that support renters. Combined with gross rent as a percentage of household income, the percent of renter-occupied units can help determine where affordable housing development can be effective in stabilizing neighborhoods during times of rapid, uneven investment.

### About the Data
All occupied units which are not owner occupied, whether they are rented for cash rent or occupied without payment of cash rent, are classified as renter-occupied. Renter-occupied status also applies to units in continuing care arrangements, such as assisted living. 

As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 years' worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this measurement are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.
