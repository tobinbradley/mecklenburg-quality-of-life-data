### Why is this important?
Electricity is a crucial component of modern life. Without it, we wouldnâ€™t be able to use computers, cell phones, refrigerators, air conditioners, and all the myriad appliances and equipment that we have come to depend on.  But using electricity can have negative environmental and financial impacts.  Most of our electricity is generated from fossil fuels (coal and natural gas), which cause air pollution and contribute to climate change. In addition, the cost of electricity can be a burden on households.  By becoming more efficient in how we use electricity, we can enjoy the comforts of modern life without causing undue pollution or wasting money.  Understanding electricity use helps us understand inefficiencies and identify opportunities for conservation.  

By looking at household electricity use by neighborhoods or block groups, we can identify which areas have opportunities to improve efficiency and target programs to help reduce energy use in those areas.  People living in those areas can also see how their electricity use compares with other parts of our community and look to improve their efficiencies.
