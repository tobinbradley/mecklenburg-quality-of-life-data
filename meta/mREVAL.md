## Median Household Income
Percent Change in Property Values 

### Why is this important?
The increase in property values across neighborhoods can make a major impact on low-income or fixed-income households. For every 100 dollars of assessed property value, a resident of the City will pay $1.30 in combined City and County taxes. If you own a home valued at $100,000 and it is revalued at $150,000 your annual tax payment will increase from $1,301 to $1,952. In 2016, more than 4,000 properties increased in tax value by 100% or more.

### About the Data
This rate of change is derived from parcel point data from 2014 (previous to the most recent property tax revaluation) and 2016. 2015 records were not used for the before-and-after comparison because many but not all records for 2015 parcels already included revalued estimates and the appeal process had not yet begun.

The number reported here is a median rate of change for every property in a blockgroup. Properties with zero value in 2014 or zero values in both years were excluded from this calculation to prevent skewing by outliers.
