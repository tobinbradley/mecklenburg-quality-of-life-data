## Population Density
Population Density 

### Why is this important?
Population density indicates the number of people living in a selected boundary divided by the area (in square miles) of the boundary. Density of population helps the City, County and other service providers know where infrastructure and other services are used most. Businesses might use population density to understand where markets exist for goods and services.

### About the Data
This measurement provides the population per square mile based on the 2010 Census using blockgroups.
