## Fire Calls for Service
Fire calls for service per 1,000 residents

### Why is this important?
Fires can cause injury, significant property damage, and even death. With proper education and attention, fire incidents are largely avoidable.  

Tracking fire-related calls for service can help fire departments, community organizations and residents identify areas where fire safety problems may exist. With proper education and attention, fire incidents are largely avoidable. Strategies to reduce fires and associated risks include education on kitchen fires and the dangers of unattended cooking, alarm installations and maintenance, identification of escape routes, and fire prevention strategies. Older adults and young children have a greater risk of fire death than the overall population. Risk of fire injury is also associated with housing age and condition, income, education, race/ethnicity, and the prevalence of smoking.
