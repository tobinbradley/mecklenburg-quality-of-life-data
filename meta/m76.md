## Home Sales Price
Average sales price of homes  

### Why is this important?
Housing continues to be the largest expense for most residents, and can be a household's greatest asset or greatest liability. Home sales prices rise and fall with a number of factors, including the economy, the housing market, the age of the housing stock, the needs of residents, and the demand for particular locations. This variable represents the sales price of homes as a single unit, and does not take into account the age, size, condition or amenities of the houses. Having a diverse housing stock available for purchase at a variety of price points is necessary to meet the needs and preferences of all residents. 

#### How are we doing?
According to the Charlotte Regional Realtor Association, the median home price in Mecklenburg County was $218,500 in 2016, up 7% from the previous year.
