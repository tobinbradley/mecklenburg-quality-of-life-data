## Impervious Area
Impervious Area

### Why is this important?
Impervious surfaces, including paved areas such as roads, parking lots, and sidewalks as well as rooftops, prevent water from draining naturally into the ground. The results are many, including an increased burden on stormwater infrastructure, erosion, reduced water quality, 'heat island effects', and both ground-level and water pollution. To learn more about the impacts of concentrated impervious area see the EPA fact sheet linked below.

### About the Data
This measurement is derived from 2009-2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program one-meter digital photography for the EPA EnviroAtlas, and reports only on the urbanized area of Durham County. It represents the percent of total land within each block group that is impervious and not covered by tree canopy.
