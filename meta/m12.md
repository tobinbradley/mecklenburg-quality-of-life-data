## Population - Youth
Percentage of the population under the age of 18

### Why is this important?
As the Charlotte area grows and changes, neighborhoods can experience large demographic changes over short periods of time. The youth population is especially dynamic, and also tends to be more diverse. Shifts in the youth population can change demand for services such as schools, child care, out-of-school time programs, and family support programs, and increase demand for certain housing types and retail goods.

#### How are we doing?
The youth population in Mecklenburg County was 23.8% in 2019, similar to North Carolina (22.9%) and the United States (22.6%). Between 2000 and 2010, the youth population in the Charlotte metro area grew by almost 33%, the 4th highest of the nation's largest metros. The pace of growth slowed somewhat during the economic recession, but overall the number of children is continuing to increase. Key regional factors that influence growth in the youth population include economic growth, housing affordability, lower population density, and growing immigrant populations.

Note: In order to make equal comparisons to the smaller areas, the values for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina and the United States in the previous paragraph are also from the American Community Survey 5-Year estimates. While more current 1-year estimates are available for the larger areas, it is important to use the most precise and most comparable 5-year estimates. [Click here]( http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html/) to learn more on the difference between 1-and 5-year estimates.
