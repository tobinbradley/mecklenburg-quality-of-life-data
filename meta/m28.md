## Proximity to Low-Cost Health Care
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of a Medicaid provider or free clinic

### Why is this important?
Free and low-cost health centers support the physical and economic wellbeing of a community and are often the only source of primary care for residents. This community-based model of care can improve individual health and also yield cost-savings to the community in reduced emergency room visits and support for healthy behaviors. Proximity to care is only one aspect of accessibility. Other factors that affect access are clinic capacity, hours of operation, transportation, cultural/language barriers, and geographic barriers such as major highways. 

#### Did you know?
National research estimates that community health centers provide one-quarter of all primary care visits for the nation's low-income population, improving health and eliminating health disparities, while producing an estimated $24 billion in annual health system savings.
