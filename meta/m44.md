## Transit Ridership
Average weekly bus and train boardings per stop

### Why is this important?
Public transportation systems can provide affordable, safe and equitable access to work, home, education, food, health services, social activities and more. Public transportation usage, particularly as an alternative to driving, may also provide health benefits such as increasing physical activity, reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, reduced fatalities and injuries, and greater social cohesion.  

Transit ridership can be impacted by a variety of factors. These factors include: bus stop location, frequency and hours of service, ridership cost, traffic congestion, fuel cost/availability, parking availability, employment rates, and more.


#### How are we doing?
Charlotte Area Transit System(CATS), transit ridership decreased substantially from an average of 443,264 weekly boardings in 2013 to an average of 128,498 in 2021. The decrease partially stems from factors related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

In 2019, 2.9% of commuters who live in Mecklenburg County traveled regularly by public transportation, compared to 1% in North Carolina and 5% nationally.

#### Did you know?
The LYNX Blue Line accounts for approximately 38% of CATS trips every week.
