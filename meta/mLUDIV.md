## Racial & Ethnic Diversity
Land Use Diversity

### Why is this important?
The diversity of land uses can reflect the richness of social and economic life in a community. Just as mixed uses in a single property are desirable for bringing people and their service or amenity needs closer to one another, the same is true within neighborhoods. Land use diversity can have transportation, health and environmental associations as well as create greater collocation of jobs and housing.

### About the Data
The indexed value of diversity of land uses in these categories: agriculture, residential, commercial, recreation, industrial, community services, public services (utilities), wild and forested lands. A higher value in this measure reflects both a higher number of land use categories present and more properties in each category. A measure of 100 would mean each of the possible types of land use is present and that there is an equal number of each. A measure of 0 would mean only one type is present. The calculation of this measurement uses the Simpson Index of Diversity.
