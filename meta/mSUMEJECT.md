## Summary Ejectment Filings
Summary Ejectment Filings

### Why is this important?
Summary ejectments are the first of two court processes for formally evicting a tenant (the second being the writ of possession). Evictions happen for a wide variety of reasons, from a tenant violating the terms of a lease to a landlord wrongfully displacing a tenant. 

While on average ~900 summary ejectments are filed in a month in Durham County, it is unclear how many informal evictions occur. 

### About the Data
